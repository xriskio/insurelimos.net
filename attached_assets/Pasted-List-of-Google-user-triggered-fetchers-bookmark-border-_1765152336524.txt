List of Google user-triggered fetchers

bookmark_border
User-triggered fetchers are initiated by users to perform a fetching function within a Google product. For example, Google Site Verifier acts on a user's request, or a site hosted on Google Cloud (GCP) has a feature that allows the site's users to retrieve an external RSS feed. Because the fetch was requested by a user, these fetchers generally ignore robots.txt rules. The general technical properties of Google's crawlers also apply to the user-triggered fetchers.

The IP ranges the user-triggered fetchers use are published in the user-triggered-fetchers.json and user-triggered-fetchers-google.json objects. The user-triggered fetchers' reverse DNS mask, depending on whether the fetcher is Google or user owned, matches ***-***-***-***.gae.googleusercontent.com or google-proxy-***-***-***-***.google.com respectively.

The following list shows the user-triggered fetchers, their user agent strings as they appear in the HTTP requests, and the products they are associated with. The list is not exhaustive, it only covers the requestors that are more likely to show up in log files and that we've received questions about.

Caution: The user agent string can be spoofed. Learn how to verify if a requestor is from Google.
