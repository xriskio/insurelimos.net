Home/Coverage/NEMT and Paratransit Insurance
Overview
Non-Emergency Medical Transportation (NEMT) and Paratransit insurance provides comprehensive coverage specifically designed for businesses that transport patients to medical appointments, dialysis centers, and healthcare facilities. For far too long, insurance companies have neglected the needs of this ever-growing industry. Our specialized program addresses the unique risks associated with transporting passengers with disabilities, special needs, and medical conditions. Whether you operate a single wheelchair-accessible van or manage a fleet of specially equipped vehicles, we provide tailored coverage at competitive rates that you can actually afford. We understand the additional responsibilities involved in patient assistance, wheelchair securement, and medical equipment handling that make your operation distinct from standard transportation services.
