### Documents

## How to qualify

### Meet Uber Black criteria

In addition to meeting the vehicle, trip, and rating criteria above, you must also possess the required documentation to receive Uber Black trips in your city.

To receive Uber Black trip requests, you must have a qualifying Uber Black vehicle and must maintain a 4.85+ rating.

### Drive when you want

When you’re online, you can choose to receive only Uber Black trip requests. Or you can also accept UberX and/or UberXL trips.

### Maintain a 4.85 rating

To be able to continue to drive with Uber Black, drivers will need to maintain a 4.85 or above rating. If your rating falls below 4.85, it will be reassessed after your next 50 trips for requalification.

## How your rating is calculated

![](https://tb-static.uber.com/prod/udam-assets/fbef96dc-ccbc-48be-ace1-9e0b0250205c.svg)

### Your rating is an average of your most recent 500 trips

- This applies to all trips (e.g., Uber Black, Uber Black SUV, UberX, UberXL)
- Canceled trips do not count toward your rating

![](https://tb-static.uber.com/prod/udam-assets/13d90c65-0e16-40a4-950e-f8a7d9d68f2e.svg)

### More high-rated trips help improve your rating

- Since your rating is an average of your last 500 trips, the more 5-star trips you do, the more your rating will go up

## Understanding your rating

Your rating is based on your most recent 500 trips, so it will change as you do more trips. Check out our [Uber Black Guide](https://www.uber.com/us/en/drive/resources/5-star-tips-premium/) for pro tips that might help you increase your rating.

If your rating falls below 4.85 after gaining eligibility, you'll have the chance to regain access to Uber Black. After every 50 trips completed, ineligible drivers will have their rating reassessed. If your rating (still based on the last 500 trips) is 4.85 or above, you'll be eligible again.
