What is a Captive Insurance Program?
A captive insurance program is a formalized self-insurance arrangement where the insured owns or participates in their own insurance company. This structure allows for greater risk retention, potential cost savings, and customized coverage solutions not available in the traditional insurance market.

Unlike traditional insurance where premiums are paid to a third-party insurer, captive participants retain ownership of premium dollars not used for claims and expenses, creating the potential for investment income and return of underwriting profit.

Our Captive Program Options
We offer a range of captive solutions to meet the needs of different transportation operations:

Deductible Options
For transportation businesses ready to take their first step into risk retention, our deductible programs offer a structured approach to assuming more risk while maintaining the security of traditional insurance.

Large deductible programs
Deductible reimbursement policies
Aggregate deductible caps
Collateral options including letters of credit, trusts, and bonds
Claims handling flexibility
These programs allow you to retain a portion of your risk while transferring catastrophic exposure to traditional insurers, creating potential for significant premium savings while maintaining protection against large losses.

Group Captives
Group captives bring together multiple transportation companies to form a shared insurance company, allowing participants to benefit from the advantages of captive ownership while spreading costs and risks.

Shared ownership structure
Lower capital requirements than single-parent captives
Risk diversification across multiple participants
Peer risk management collaboration
Potential for dividends based on group performance
Access to reinsurance markets
Group captives are particularly effective for medium to large transportation operations that want captive benefits without the full capital commitment of forming their own captive.

For the largest transportation operations, we offer fully customized captive solutions tailored to your specific risk profile, financial objectives, and operational needs.
