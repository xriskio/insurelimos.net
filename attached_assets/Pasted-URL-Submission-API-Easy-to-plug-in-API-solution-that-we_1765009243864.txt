LinkedIn now uses the URL submission API to notify Bing about updates to profiles and job postings. This cuts the search index update time at Bing from weeks to minutes. As a result, we see a significant increase in traffic to LinkedIn from Bing.

We also improved BingBot crawl efficiency, saving processing costs for both companies and reducing our respective carbon emissions.

Having over 1.5bn listings represents a huge challenge and customer opportunity to keep indexes up to date for both eBay & Bing. eBay uses the Bing URL submission API to notify Bing whenever important new pages are created or updated.

Helping Bing search users find the most relevant eBay products has been one of the key goals for eBay, and the URL submission API integration helps us achieve that seamlessly.

Love2Dev.com was one of the early adopters of Bing’s URL Submission API. I knew when I publish a new article I could see indexing and ranking in 30-45 minutes because that is just when I checked.

Last night I refreshed some old content on jQuery, even gave it a fresh URL slug. I checked 10 minutes later and there I was #2 for ‘jquery obsolete’ on Bing.com. "

Today I wrote an article on Chrome’s mixed content strategy. This time I checked a minute or so later and there I am, #2 again! ‘chrome mixed content’ This is sick guys. Even my wife was like’ WOW!

Bing’s new API URL Submission API has been a godsend for Bizapedia.com as it has enabled us to submit in real time new company profiles, reviews, and questions the moment they are added to our system.
Additionally, as we average over 200,000 new company profiles weekly, the increased quota granted to our site has enabled us to submit our new pages to Bing without any delay. Integrating the complete API into our custom built management system was actually quite simple.
Essentially, everything you see in Bing Webmasters Tools is exposed in the API. At this point, we rarely even have to open the Bing Webmasters portal as the API has allowed us to automate everything from submitting urls, disavowing bad links, and monitoring crawl errors.
