## **What is Uber Black Insurance, and do you need it?**

ABI Uber Black insurance is a specialized type of commercial auto insurance designed for livery drivers using their personal vehicles to work for Uber Black.


Your personal auto insurance policy typically does not cover accidents or incidents that occur while you’re on the job. Uber Black insurance bridges this gap, ensuring drivers are protected.


- Hold commercial auto insurance
- Vehicles must be of a luxury standard
- Vehicles must be no more than 5 years old
- Drivers must maintain a star rating of 4.85 or higher

Unlike Uber X, your personal auto insurance policy does not qualify you to drive for Uber Black. You must be covered by a commercial auto insurance policy to meet Uber Black requirements.


Our insurance meets Uber Black’s requirements and protects you against third-party damages or claims—even if you’re at fault.


Choosing the right insurance doesn’t have to be hard. ABI makes getting Uber Black insurance simple.

## **Our frequently asked questions**

How much is Uber Black insurance?

Our prices start from $599/month in low risk cities.

However, the cost of your insurance will depend on individual circumstances. Such as location, vehicle type and coverage needs.

What does Uber Black insurance cover?

Our policies include liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage designed for luxury livery vehicles.

Does Uber Black insurance qualify for commercial auto insurance?

Yes.

Uber Black insurance typically qualifies for commercial auto insurance because Uber Black drivers operate as professional livery services, transporting passengers for hire. Most personal auto insurance policies exclude coverage for commercial use, which is why Uber requires drivers to have commercial auto insurance or a rideshare endorsement.

## **Key Factors:**

1. Uber's Insurance: Uber provides some coverage when drivers are logged in and actively driving passengers, but there may be gaps in coverage, especially when waiting for a ride request.
2. Commercial Auto Policy: Since Uber Black is a premium service, drivers are often required to carry a commercial auto policy instead of just a personal auto policy with a rideshare endorsement.
3. State & Carrier Requirements: Some states and insurance carriers have specific requirements for rideshare and livery drivers, making a commercial auto policy mandatory for Uber Black drivers.
