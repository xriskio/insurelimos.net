Frequently Asked Questions
Common questions about taxi insurance coverage.

What insurance limits do I need for my taxi business?
Insurance limits for taxi operators typically depend on several factors, including state and municipal requirements, the size of your operation, and your risk tolerance. Most taxi operators need at least $1,000,000 in auto liability coverage, though requirements can vary significantly by location. Our team can help you determine the appropriate coverage limits based on your specific situation and local regulations.

Does my taxi insurance cover me when I'm not carrying passengers?
Yes, our taxi insurance policies provide coverage whether you're carrying passengers, en route to pick up a fare, or off-duty. However, it's important to note that some policies may have different coverage limits or deductibles depending on whether you're carrying passengers at the time of an incident.

How can I reduce my taxi insurance premiums?
Several factors can help reduce your taxi insurance costs, including implementing comprehensive driver training programs, maintaining a clean claims history, installing vehicle safety features like dash cams and GPS tracking, and considering higher deductibles. Our team can work with you to develop a risk management strategy that may help lower your premiums over time.

Do I need special insurance if I operate both as a taxi and for rideshare platforms?
Yes, if you operate both as a traditional taxi and through rideshare platforms, you'll need insurance that covers both types of operations. Standard taxi insurance may not cover you while you're operating through a rideshare app, and rideshare insurance typically doesn't cover traditional taxi operations. We offer hybrid policies designed specifically for drivers who operate in multiple capacities.

How quickly can I get proof of insurance for my taxi license or medallion renewal?
Once your policy is bound, we can typically provide proof of insurance immediately. For license or medallion renewals, we understand the time-sensitive nature of these requirements and prioritize providing the necessary documentation quickly. Our team can also work directly with your licensing authority if needed to ensure a smooth renewal process.
